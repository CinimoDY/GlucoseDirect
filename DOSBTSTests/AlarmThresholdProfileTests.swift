/// Pin the "active profile always wins, no pinning" behavior at the day/night
/// boundary for two specific decisions that read `state.alarmLow`:
///
/// 1. Predictive-low alarm flag clearing (`GlucoseNotification.swift:85-90`):
///    `glucose >= state.alarmLow + 10` clears the flag.
/// 2. Treatment cycle recovery check (`TreatmentCycleMiddleware.swift:82-88`):
///    `glucose >= state.alarmLow` ends the cycle as recovered.
///
/// Both decisions inherit the active profile's threshold at the moment they
/// run. The plan accepted this (no cycle pinning) — these tests guard against
/// a regression that reintroduces pinning, and also document the failure mode
/// users with tight-day / permissive-night configs need to know about.
///
/// The deeper fix (lock-at-flag-set-time) is tracked separately if/when a
/// user reports the failure mode in practice.
